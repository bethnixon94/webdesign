		<p>We are husband and wife, owning, operating and maintaining our dream together. We have a total of 7 kids between the two of us and our vision is for them to take over some day. Since we are family owned and operated we put an emphasis on family focus, but we also serve military families, schools, non-profit organizations, local events and company parties.  We currently serve our local community here in Colorado Springs, as well as our surrounding areas. Our goal is to stay affordable and accessible, as well as flexible and adaptable to the ever changing economy.</p>
		<br> 
		<p>
		All of our products are meant to make you feel special or to provide cherished memories for the entire family. Our lotion candles are meant to help pamper yourself, the party supply rentals are meant to help make somebody elseâ€™s day memorable, and the custom t-shirts are meant to be cherished by everyone. We aim to offer personalized service and exceptional products at the best price to keep bringing you back every time. </p>
